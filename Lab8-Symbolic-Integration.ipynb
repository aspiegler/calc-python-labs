In [previous Python labs](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ZfB95oBzpcOLRTQ_aEhCjIoBuOMDykh3?usp=sharing), we have seen how to perform symbolic differentiation using `sympy.diff()`, solve algebraic equations with `sym.solve()`, evaluate symbolic functions with `sympy.evalf()`, and simplify algebraic expressions with `sympy.simplify()`. In this lab, we use built-in SymPy functions to perform symbolic integration to evaluate both indefinite and definite integrals.\n"
